          FACT SHEET: How the Inflation Reduction Act Helps Asian American,
          Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Communities
        </h1>
        <p>
          By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering
          on his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
          including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA
          and NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription
          drug costs, health care costs, and energy costs. It’s the most
          aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll
          lower the deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay
          their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per year will pay a
          penny more in taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
          interests to pass this historic legislation that lowers costs for
          Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
          building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up
          and the middle out.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</h1>
        <p>
          The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs,
          including prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance
          coverage for AA and NHPI families.

          <li>Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a month’s supply.</li>
          <li>Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine, for Medicare beneficiaries.</li>
          <li>Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of high-cost drugs and requiring drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices faster than inflation.</li>
